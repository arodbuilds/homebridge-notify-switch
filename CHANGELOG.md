## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Dynamic platform `NotifySwitch` that exposes one HomeKit switch per configured entry. Turning a switch on sends its actions and the switch turns itself off after one second.
- Master switch (default name "Notifications Enabled") that suppresses every send while off. Its state survives a Homebridge restart.
- Per-switch cooldown, enable flag, failure mode, and optional failure contact sensor that trips on send failure and resets on the next successful send or after a timeout.
- Startup validation that reports every configuration issue in one pass with its field path, including "did you mean" hints for mistyped provider and group ids. Nothing is registered while the configuration has errors.
- Phone numbers without a country code are normalized to E.164 using `defaultCountry` and the normalized value is logged once at startup.
- Template variables `{{switchName}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{date}}`, and `{{datetime}}` in message bodies and email subjects.
- Twilio provider for the `sms` channel using Node's built-in `fetch`, with a 10 second timeout, one retry with a 2 second backoff (rate limit `Retry-After` honored once), and at most 5 requests in flight per provider.
- Configuration validation for the `smtp` and `telegram` provider types and for Twilio `email`. Sending on these channels reports a clear "not yet implemented" failure until a later release.
- Logging that masks phone numbers and email addresses at info level and never logs credentials or message bodies unless `debug` is on.
- `config.schema.json` covering the full configuration with password fields for secrets and provider fields shown only for the selected type.
- CI workflow that lints and builds on Node 22 and 24.
